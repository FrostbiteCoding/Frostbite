{"name":"FrostbiteCoding","tagline":"A way to get to know Minecraft in code","body":"#Learning to Code\r\nI started learning to code about four years ago when I first got minecraft. I instantly fell in love with how it felt to figure something out step by step. Later, after I had learned allot from Java coding, I decided to broaden my view on coding. I've started learning lua and coding for Video Games, and some for terraria. It's made me appreciate all the work coders do just to put something out for other people to enjoy.\r\n\r\n#My Goal \r\nSomething that came along a few months ago, was the desire to teach other people how to code. I pushed the idea aside thinking not much of it. Then not long after a friend asked me if I could teach him hoe to make a minecraft mod, and I decided that I would at least try. I ended up having allot of fun teaching and also learning some things myself. So my goal is to try to teach people how to mod. Starting from the basics and turning into something more advanced. \r\n\r\n#Where does GitHub come in?\r\nI'm using Github to host my mod code for anyone to look at and learn from. If I add anything more to it, I'll be sure to keep it up to date.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anyone would like to learn how to make a minecraft mod, I'd be happy to teach if you are willing to learn.\r\nI'll be starting a blog soon to release a tutorial every week on something new.\r\nIf you have any questions please send me a email at voidgames15@gmail.com\r\n\r\nI Hope you all have a great rest of the day.\r\n\r\n-Jordan\r\n\r\n#Links\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSource Code: https://github.com/FrostbiteCoding/Frostbite\r\n\r\nBlog: Coming Soon      ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
